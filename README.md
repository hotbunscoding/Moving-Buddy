# Moving Buddy

The main purpose of this project is to help people research for moving to different cities. This script will scrape the city subreddit, qualify comments based off of a certain criteria, and send those comments to ChatGPT for analysis. Not fully functional at this time.

This program will use a variety of sources to determine city desirability including Reddit, ChatGPT, Trulia, Google Places and Directions APIFuture roadmap is to support compartmentalization of features to allow users to only use one feature at a time. Current functionality is to ask users for a city and then run all the features mentioned above.

**Current Functionality:**

Reddit Comment Collection - Functional

ChatGPT - Functional on its own, needs to be integrated with the main script

Google Places - Functional, needs to be integrated

Google Maps - Functional, need to implement scoring system

Trulia - Mostly functional, need to improve error catching when data is missing

SQL Features - Mostly functional

**Roadmap:**

Google Maps - Collect and search for a list of desirable City attributes. Collect general distance, distance to each other, and distance to home or City center
More robust functionality in general
