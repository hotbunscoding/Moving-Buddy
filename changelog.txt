Bug Fixes:

- Fixed NoneType issue when Redditor is deleted/removed
- Fixed SQL writing issue
- Fixed ChatGPT persistence issue

Miscellaneous:

- Expanded logging to help with debugging
- Removed redundant RedditBot parent class and Reply(RedditBot) child class (not needed for this project)
- Added auto_qualified parameter to RedditPost.get_relevant_comments() method. Parameter is used to automatically
 qualify all comments under a qualified submission since those comments will likely pertain to moving even though there
  won't be matched terms directly in the comments themselves.
